# Axum API - With Database

An amalgamation of the "hello world" and "graceful shutdown" examples from the [Axum github repo](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/tree/main/examples). I added in tracing capability to provide information for debugging, etc. The color-eyre crate is added for error handling.

This API can talk to and manage a SQLite database.
